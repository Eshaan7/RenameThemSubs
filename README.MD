# Rename Them Subs
## Download
I compiled the python script using <a href="www.pyinstaller.org">pyinstaller</a> and converted it into a standalone windows executable(.exe). It can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/jPnwf7"><b>here</b></a>.
## What the script does
You download a TV show from torrent and find the suitable subtitle files from some website.
Renaming every subtitle file to match the video file is a pain in the ass, isn't it?
That's where this script comes in handy.

## Motivation behind such a silly project
A few years back I would often have to manually rename all subtitle files to match episode name and I always wondered why isn't there a
software that does it for you ? Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzWNBmjyv7Y">fine, I'll do it myself.</a>
