# Rename Them Subs
## What the script does
You download a TV show from torrent and find the suitable subtitle files from some website.
Renaming every subtitle file to match the video file is a pain in the ass, isn't it?
That's where this script comes in handy.

## Motivation behind such a silly project
A few years back I would often have to manually rename all subtitle filew and I always wondered why isn't there a
software that does it for you ? Well, fine, I'll do it myself.
