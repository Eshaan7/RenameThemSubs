# Rename Them Subs
## What the script does
You download a TV show from torrent and find the suitable subtitle files from some website.
Renaming every subtitle file to match the video file is a pain in the ass, isn't it?
That's where this script comes in handy.

## Motivation behind such a silly project
As someone who often downloads bunch of TV shows from torrent and have to manually
rename every damn subtitle file, I decided to make this script as to make the computer do it for me. 
Lazy or genius? you decide.
